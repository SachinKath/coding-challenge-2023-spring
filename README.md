In my project, I tried to create a Neighbors classifier model which uses the data to predict star types. I initially spliced my data to have a train data and a test data set. Afterwards, the Neighbors model finds the closest points surrounding the actual value from the test data set. I then printed out the classification model data which showed that my model was at a 62% accuracy at predicting the star type from the Temperature, Luminosity, Radius, and Absolute Magnitude.
